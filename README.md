Our client was the City of Gosnells,the proposed application was to be designed to encourage businesses to complete the security checklist and improve the security of the business if needed.
The goal being improving checklist participants by increasing ease of use and accessibility, thereby improving business security to reduce crime and minimise the effects of any potential crime of the business.

</br>
The application questions were fed from a URL in the form of a JSON file provided by the City of Gosnells, this JSON file was loaded through a connection to their website within the application. Doing this allowed the questions to be updated by the City of Gosnells without the need to update the application.
Feedback to the user is provided after the completion of the checklist. The feedback is generated based on the user's answers to the questions in the checklist. Feedback is accompanied by a graphic and a rating of the business security.

Notifications are pushed to the user to keep their security up to date. The Notifications will remind the user to re-do the checklist at set interval of time or when the checklist has been updated. The time can be chosen by the user in the preferences activity where they can also adjust the notifications.
